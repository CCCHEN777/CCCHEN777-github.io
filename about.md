This site was created by Haana Janmohamed, an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin. She created the site using the Jekyll Minima template. She would like to give credit to the [NBC Lab](https://nbclab.github.io/) and [Drummond Lab](http://drummondlab.org/) for their help and inspiration in the creation of this site. This website adapts and adopts some code from their site ([NBC Lab GitHub](https://github.com/NBCLab/NBCLab.github.io) and [Drummond Lab GitHub](https://github.com/drummondlab/drummondlab.github.io)) To view our code, click [here](https://github.com/UTCogNeuroLab/UTCogNeuroLab.github.io).
